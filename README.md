# SpinLatticeSimulation
SpinLatticeSimulation is a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation tool for studying spin lattices. This repository implements Monte Carlo methods to simulate and analyze the behavior of spin systems, providing insights into phase transitions, magnetic properties, and lattice dynamics.

## Results
These are the results obtained by running the algorithm for a 5x5 2-Dimensional lattice with random spins.
### Magnetization vs. KT:

As temperature (KT) increases, the average magnetization decreases, indicating a phase transition from an ordered to a disordered state.
Higher interaction strengths (J) lead to greater magnetization, even at higher temperatures.
### Spin Configurations:
Initial and final spin configurations reveal the system's transition dynamics.
At low KT, spins align more uniformly, while at high KT, spins appear random.
### Visualization
